							<h2>Background:</h2>
							<p>NFTScoring is the place for you to discover, analyze and trade NFTs, giving you the superpowers to understand the NFT market in any given moment, make the best decisions, and take faster actions. We designed a mobile interface to help experienced NFT collectors more easily find investment data. Our interface helps individuals with significant NFT experience make better decisions.</p>

							<h2>Sketches</h2>
							<p>Based off observations and responses, two personas were developed for users of the vending machine at Blue Room. Click on each image to expand.</p>
							<h3><b>Design 1</b></h3> is a sophomore at Brown who is studying at the Blue Room. He has a computer science project due at 9am the next day, and it is currently 3am. He goes to the vending machine in search of caffeine to wake himself up.
							<br>
							<br id="fifth"> The instructions for the payment methods were too unclear for Larry, who is extremely fatigued, sleepy, and has brain fog, so he was confused by whether the machine acceped flex points or not.
						       Larry represents a user of the chosen interface because most people that I interviewed was seeking an item to remedy a negative bodily symptom, and one common one was sleepiness.

							<h2>Interactive Prototype and Feedback</h2>
							<p>We built a figma mockup of the wireframes (shown right) to bring to the studio critique. Overall, feedback was mostly positive with the main suggestions being differentiate the buy and sell pages, add an "add favorites" function, give users more flexibility to edit their profile, and our overall dark mode was hard to read. With this feedback, we redesigned the interface with more attractive colors to drown out the black background. On top of this we added an option to favorite a particular NFT, and gave users a better experience when viewing their own profile. The finished result can be found below.</p>

							<h2 >Observations and Responses</h2>
							<h3>1. All users: </h3>
							<p> - Had to swipe more than one time to get the machine  to register their cash 
							<br> - Used flex points rather than credit card or cash   
							<br> - Seemed to struggle when they bent down to swipe their card   
							<br> - Were confused as to when they could select a snack   
							<br> - Opted for a high-sugar snack </p>
							<h3 id="fourth">2. Some users: </h3>
							<p>	- Had a skittles packet stuck and had to shake the vending machine to dispense their snack
							<br> - Had to press the snack code buttons multiple times to get their desired item 
							<h2>Questions: </h2>
								</p> <b>What is your most common way of getting food?</b> 
								<br> a. Ratty (cafeteria)
								<br> a. Ivy room (cafeteria)
								<br> c. Thayer street
								<br>  <b>Why did you use the vending machine, rather than [most common way of getting food]?</b>
								<br> a. Cafeteria was closed/ line was too long
								<br> b. Everything else was closed already (it’s currently 2am) 
								<br> c. It takes flex points, and I don’t want to spend money on Thayer 
								<br> <b>How do you benefit from your interaction with the vending machine?</b>
								<br> a. It outputs beverages with caffeine to help me stay up and study
								<br> b. It’s a good study break, get to have fun with some snacks
								<br> c. The sugar gives me energy to get on with the rest of my day 
								<br> <b>What activity were you engaging in before coming here, and where are you going after this? </b>
								<br> a. Was studying, and am going to go back to studying
								<br> b. I just finished working out, and am on the way to class
								<br> c. I was studying and am going to take a walk 
								<br>  <b>How far did you walk to get to this vending machine? (from last point of rest)</b>
								<br> a. Around 20 steps 
								<br> b. Around 30 seconds 
								<br> c. Around 1 minute 
								<br> <b>Was your experience with the vending machine what you expected?</b>
								<br> a. A snack got stuck 
								<br> b. I expected it to be hard to use flex points, and the payment swiper was definitely not that responsive 
								<br> c. I’ve used this many times before, so I know my way around it
